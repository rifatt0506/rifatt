Title: Design UI Prototype: PetLamb App - Live Monitor Screen
Description: Design a mobile UI prototype for the 'PetLamb' app's Live Monitor screen.

**Details:**
- Display a dark-mode interface showing a simulated live video feed of a sleeping lamb on a cozy straw bed.
- Top overlay: semi-transparent, shows time ('11:24 AM') and Wi-Fi indicator.
- Bottom: floating mint green (#9ED0C3) action button with microphone icon for 'Talk to Pet'.
- Bottom navigation bar: highlight 'Monitor' (camera icon) tab.
- Follow glassmorphism, soft blur, and pastel color palette as described in the prompt.
- Use 'Poppins' or 'Nunito' font and generous rounded corners (24px).

Ensure the design is consistent with the rest of the app.
